Graphix – Interactive Function Plotter
Graphix is a lightweight, browser-based function plotter that enables users to visualize mathematical functions in real time. With a simple and intuitive interface, users can enter equations and instantly see their corresponding graphs. This tool is useful for students, teachers, and developers who need quick and interactive function visualization.

Features
✅ Supports Various Functions
Enter mathematical equations in the form of y = f(x), such as y = x^2, y = sin(x), or y = log(x).
Automatically corrects input variations (e.g., x = y is converted to y = x).
🎯 Instant Graph Rendering
Uses the function-plot library to generate smooth and accurate graphs.
Automatically scales the axes based on the entered function.
Allows multiple functions to be plotted on the same graph.
🛠 User-Friendly Interface
Minimalist design for easy interaction.
Displays error messages for invalid inputs.
Responsive layout that works across different screen sizes.
⚡ Lightweight and Fast
Runs entirely in the browser with no dependencies beyond JavaScript.
No need for external software installations.
How to Use
Enter a Function:

Type an equation like y = x^2 in the input box.
Ensure the equation is in the correct format (i.e., y = ...).
Plot the Function:

Click the "Plot" button to generate the graph.
The function will be rendered in the graphing area.
Modify and Explore:

Try different equations to see how they behave.
Adjust the equation and re-plot to explore changes dynamically.
Installation & Setup
Graphix is simple to integrate into any project.

Option 1: Use Online
You can use Graphix directly in your browser—just enter an equation and see the graph instantly.

Option 2: Add to Your Project
